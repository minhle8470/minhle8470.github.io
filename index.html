                <p>
                  Have been given the opportunity to teach at a secondary school
                  and have never looked back. Since recieved tertiary education 
                  on teaching have been able to apply what was taught at ACU, which
                  came to good use in terms of classroom management and the ability
                  to help students with different types of ability to improve in 
                  mathematics while engaging with the students creating a vocal classroom.

                <p>
                  The advancement of working mathematically with numbers and problem-solving
                  is a crucial skill that focuses on developing increasingly sophisticated and 
                  refined mathematical understanding, fluency, communication, logical reasoning, 
                  analytical thought and problem-solving skills. The ability to make informed 
                  decisions and to interpret and apply mathematics in a variety of contexts 
                  is an essential component of students' preparation for life in the 21st century.

                <p>
                  Current technologies are becoming obsolete at a rapid rate and new generations will need to 
                  be flexible to accommodate changes as they emerge, and will require lifelong learning.
                  It is important that students learn about, choose and use appropriate information and 
                  software technology and develop an informed awareness of its capacities, scope, limitations and implications. 
                  Students can expect to work and live in environments requiring highly developed levels of computing and technological literacy.

                      graded exams, assignments, projects which will determine whether students have 
                      learned what they were expected to retain during the defined instructional period.

                      <strong>Formative Assessment:</strong> in-process evaluations of student learning

                      feedback for educator to understand what students do not grasp and needs further 
                      revision.
                      <br />
                      <em>Example:</em> At the end of each mathematical topic, there will be a topic 
                      test/quiz based on what was done in previous lessons to ensure and modify our 
                      teaching approach which suits the need of the students.

                      which is being taught that week.
                      <br/>
                      <em>Example:</em> There is a need to analyse the classroom to check if all students are able to
                      comprehend what the class intentions of the lesson, if students are unable to understand is required
                      re-establish the foundation of the lesson through a different method.

                      for their own learning growth.
                      <br />
                      <em>Example:</em> Support students to self-reflect on the lesson through a form, to dissect and allow students
                      to consider on the area of mathematics that students need to work on. And will require students to hand back the form
                      so educator can also can determine what is needed to improve our lesson plan.
